# PythonCrashCourse
Python-Crash-Course-Part1 This is the python crash course series .
I am going to put things in such a way that everybody could understand (beginner to expert)
For Intermediates, this could be the revision of their python language.
I'm going to mention the main topics that a python programmer should have knowledge about.
In coming days , I've decided that I'm going to create Python essential libraries notebooks which would be helpful in the field of DataScience.
